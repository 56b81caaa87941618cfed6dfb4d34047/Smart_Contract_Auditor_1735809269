Created a contract that allows users to stake tokens, withdraw their stake, and claim rewards.\n2. Implemented functions for checking staked balance and rewards.\n3. Used OpenZeppelin's IERC20, SafeERC20, and Ownable contracts for token interactions and access control.\n4. Added events for important actions (Staked, Withdrawn, RewardsClaimed).\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The staking token address is set in the constructor. You need to replace the placeholder address with the actual token address before deployment.\n2. The reward rate is initially set to 1 token per second. You may want to adjust this based on your specific requirements.\n3. The contract assumes that rewards are paid in the same token that is staked.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Replace the placeholder token address in the constructor with your actual staking token address.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. Ensure that the contract has enough balance of the staking token to pay out rewards.\n4. Users need to approve the contract to spend their tokens before staking.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider getting a security audit before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
